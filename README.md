# Graph algorithms implementations
Implementations of four graph algorithms: Dijkstra's shortest path, Prim's and Kruskal's minimum spanning tree and ???.

## Dijkstra's Shortest Path
To build and run:
```bash
cd dijkstra
make
./dijkstra <options>
```
Options:
```bash
-h              : displays this help and exits
-o <file>       : redirects output to file
-f <file>       : indicates the file that contains the graph 
-i              : starting vertex
```
